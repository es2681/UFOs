# UFOs
## Overview
In this module, a table of all documented UFO sightings between January 1 and 13, 2010 was created. The table includes information pertaining to the sighting date, location (city, state, country), shape, duration, and any relevant comments. The data can be filtered by date, city, state, country, or shape.   

## Results
To explore the data, UFO sightings can be filtered by sighting date, city, state, country, and shape. Multiple filters can be applied at the same time. To perform this task, go to the Filter Search section on the web page (see photo below). Simply type in your search criteria into the appropriate search box. For example, to search for sightings in New York, type "NY" into the "Enter a State" text box. Either press enter or click anywhere on the page outside the text box and the data will be filtered according to your search parameters. If no sightings are displayed, it means there is no data that matches your search criteria.

## Summary 
While this program adequately filters the data, the program is rigid and will only filter the data according to exact parameters. For example, the program is case sensitive (however I modified the program so that it would not be case sensitive). Without the modification, it does not recognize "NY" or "New York" as being the same state as "ny". Also, it can only filter one paramter per search criteria at a time. For example, the program cannot search multiple cities or a range of dates. Lastly, users typically expect to click a button to run their search. Going forward, I recommend adressing each of these issues further to enhance user experience.
